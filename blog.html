                            <p>  I'm Sayed Soroush Hashemi, but people labeled me as "coder", "sayed", "boring" and ... . Am I boring really? There are lots of things I do to make people happy and to have fun, but turned out I'm not very good at this. Any help will be appreciated greatly to solve this not logical problem.</p>
                            <p>  Here I try to write funny things I find and to make fun with everything in good ways. If you have any funny idea, just let me know if you want.</p>
                            <p>  thank you</p>

                            <p>  Believe it or not I wasn't the only uninvited guest. :) We filled the hall to its neck. Lots of guests and staffs stood the whole party(including me:( ). Even the floor was fulled with people just sat in the nearest place they found. There were, in some cases, 2 people on 1 seat(and sometimes 3:|). Now you do understand better the sentence "We filled the hall to its neck.". I had a good place, behind some computers, on that exploding hall, hot with a great view on people heads. I left the party sooner to not to miss dinner in dormitory. :( (poor decision)</p>
                            <p>  The party was great and all parts were perfect, especially the clip about Sharif_ID :). That was awesome. I strongly recommend you to find that clip in any way, because it really worth anything :). It'll calm you down any time you get angry about Sharif_ID. There was also a singing part of "Mohammadmahdi Jahanara" and "Pooya Mirhoseini". That was funny. There were lots of music parts(great ones indeed), but I cant recall them well. I just remember there were lots of great music played in that party by first years students. Hope to find a good seat next year to enjoy the whole party.</p>
                            <p>  There was a special part that I enjoyed very much(maybe many other people did too.). In party, staffs introduced us a new game(a physical one) and invited a few guusts to play that. Surprisingly one of the players were the wellknown "Sadjad Fouladi". The game was a funny way of having fun. the following image is a funny scene of this game. Lots of other funny moments happend in that game, like when "Sadjad Fouladi" were accused to be the reason of loser lose and when "Mohammad Razeghi" was struggling to stay with players and push someone else out of the game. I really pity all people weren't there. They really missed an odd fun indeed.</p>

                            <p>  In the end I really want to thank everyone who did anything for this party. I wish them and you goodness and fun in any moment in your life. :)</p>

                        </header>
                        <article class='postContent'>
                            <p>  I'm pretty sure most of you heard about <a href="www.happyxfriends.tk">HappyXFriends</a>. If you didn't, then I will tell you what it is and why it is fun :). This thing arised in the middle of the first semester of 1393 in Sharif University of Technology. At the beginning it was supposed to be a hurtful group which wants to annoy first years, but after a while it showed its happy face and tried to make people happy with funny ideas.</p>
                            <p>  In the beginning when it hacked many first year students' education system account password and changed it, people feared, but they said in their website that they are not going to do anything bad. They declared that a game is on the way for those who had been hacked and in short they load a system on their website which could tell you that you are in the game or not(but required your national ID code for it). After a while they did something funny: they named some players on their website :) and this engaged people to check that website in any spare time. And Finally the game begins</p>
                            <p>  There were 2 mission in the first game: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>who is in your team?</li>
                                <li>where is this place?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> In the first mission you were be showed a couple of images of your team in the website and you should find them just by images(no names mentioned in the website, but there were ways like google image search anh so on). 
                                The next mission was more fun. A picture was showed to you and you along your team were asked to get a selfie altogether in that place. When you are done, you send them that selfie and they send you your passwords.</p>
                            <p>  Some people send their passwords to take part in the game voluntary :), but on the other hand some people weren't interested in that game at all. Non of those I knew played. They all asked the education office for a new password. But the determined HappyXFriends didn't stop. They came up with another funny idea just in time :).</p>
                            <p>  Almost all first year students had "calculus 1" and HappyXFriends used it in their own way. At the beginning of the next semester, when "calculus 1" grades has been published, they ran a game on their website. The game was: "Which one of these two people you think got a better grade in calculus 1?". People were shown by their images, so it was again "Who is this?". Many people really welcomed this game and played it for hours(including me and many of my friends.). It gave you +1 score for each correct guess and -1 score for each wrong guess. We reached 128 score one night. :) it was fun.</p>
                            <p>  This game(the second game) is still on <a href="happyxfriends.tk">their website</a>for those who want to play. Have fun with that. We(as players) should wait for the next mission. Wish us success :)</p>
